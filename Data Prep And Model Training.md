## 🎯 Model Target Variables

| Target Variable      | Units | Typical Range       |
| -------------------- | ----- | ------------------- |
| Range_km             | km    | ~120 to 700         |
| Price_USD            | USD   | ~18,000 to 120,000+ |
| Battery_Capacity_kWh | kWh   | ~30 to 120          |

These form the **continuous output vector** modeled by the CVAE.

---

## 🔧 Encoding and Scaling

Continuous targets are standardized. Categorical conditions are one-hot encoded and combined with binary-engineered indicators.

| Processing Step                         | Resulting Output Form    |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Standardizing continuous targets        | Y_scaled (N × 3 matrix)  |
| One-hot encoding regional and chemistry | C_encoded (N × ~20 dims) |
| Appending binary condition flags        | C_final (complete C set) |

Final shapes used in the model:

* Continuous outputs **Y:** (N × 3)
* Condition vectors **C:** (N × ~20)

## 🏗️ Conditional VAE Architecture

The CVAE learns to reconstruct target vehicle specifications conditioned on design and contextual factors.

### Encoder

Takes the combined vehicle specification and condition vector to produce a latent representation.

### Latent Dimension

A compact 6-dimensional latent space is used to balance expressive capacity and generalization.

### Decoder

Reconstructs the continuous target specifications conditioned on the same categorical feature vector.

## 🔥 β-Annealing Training Strategy

A **β-annealing schedule** is used to gradually introduce the KL-divergence regularization to avoid posterior collapse.

| Phase          | β (KL Weight)      | Training Effect                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Early Training | Low → Gradual Rise | Prioritizes reconstruction stability            |
| Mid Training   | Increasing to ~1.0 | Encourages formation of structured latent space |
| Final          | Maintained ~1.0    | Ensures smooth and generalizable representation |

This approach produces stable, disentangled latent structure while preserving generative variability.

## 📈 Model Performance

### Standardized Scale Metrics

| Feature          | MAE  | RMSE |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Range_km         | 0.51 | 0.64 |
| Price_USD        | 0.32 | 0.37 |
| Battery_Capacity | 0.56 | 0.70 |

### Converted Back to Real Units

| Feature          | MAE Approx. | Interpretation                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Range_km         | ~74 km      | Comparable to trim or tire configuration effects   |
| Price_USD        | ~$10.9k     | Matches typical MSRP variance bands                |
| Battery_Capacity | ~21 kWh     | Reflects distinct chemistry and platform groupings |

This confirms the model learned practical market and engineering tradeoffs.

## 🚀 Model Usage

The trained decoder can synthesize new EV specifications conditioned on targeted design constraints such as:

* Region of manufacture
* Battery chemistry type
* Market price segment
* Charging ecosystem compatibility

This enables structured **EV concept generation and scenario modeling**.
